Innovation is doing the things we do every day a little bit better. It is not about saying ‘yes’ to everything rather it’s about saying ‘no’ to all but the most crucial things happening.
Developed agriculture needs to find new ways to improve efficiency. One approach is to utilise available information technologies in the form of more intelligent machines to reduce and target energy inputs in more effective ways than in the past. 
So, we present an idea of “Multiutility Agri_Bot” which proves its innovation in the agricultural field. Looking into the current day situation, significant implementation of technology and improvement is not seen in the field of Agriculture. Misuse of irrigation and watering facility thought limited amount of water is available for that purpose. Wastage of crop plants and also limited yield is obtained due to overseeing in an area or overcrowded cultivation. Unawareness about field status and natural factors like the humidity of air, moisture of soil, heat etc and inappropriate irrigation thereby. So, the above issues found in a survey pushed up a need for this project and we put forward an idea to implement all solutions to those in a single Robot for agriculture. 
We have developed a low cost, reliable, efficient system for agriculture by encapsulating and integrating all requirements to solve the most generic problem and increase productivity.
